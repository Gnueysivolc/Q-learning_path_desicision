# first time making some ai stuff
this project uses Q-learning with Qtable and the Qfunction looks at four steps later of find the road of maze,


after training the data, maybe can just calculate the Q table from the data stored in Qtable.txt and get rib of other operation to optimize it
still the circle stucks in some longer dead end ince it can only foresee four steps later
i dont know how to solve without foreseeing more steps but it causes a lot of operations
maybe add a time punishment?
someone help if can
